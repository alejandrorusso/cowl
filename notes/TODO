we definitely need to state explicitly (possibly even in the intro?)
that our design doesn't break legacy pages/scripts (true, yes?), and
explicitly explain why this is the case in the design section.

can Deian or EZ please convert the handwritten app figures into
computer-drawn (i.e., straight lines, typeset text) ones? Thanks!

need to update ezyang-adblock.pdf to incorporate numbers (to match
other figures)!

overall, "tab" depiction in figures won't be understood as "implying
DOM" by OSDI reviewers; need to draw DOM explicitly within an origin's
frame (e.g., as a rectangle within the frame)

one more pretty relevant piece of related work:

Embassies: Radically Refactoring the Web (Howell et al., NSDI 2013)
Broadly speaking, takes on confining malicious code supplied by web
servers within the browser. Pretty different than what we're doing in
design, but not unrelated in end-to-end goal. Also a *very* impressive
piece of work (won best paper).
