BK: I think Section 2 has grown too long. Can we give two-sentence high-level
summaries of CSP and CORS, and just cite the (very nice) text on them in the
HotOS paper? The browser background before we get into motivating examples is
now a full page, and that's too long. By the time we're done with our examples,
it's nearly page 6! This cannot work for holding a reader's interest.
(Compare: at what point in paper did section 3 start in submitted version?)

need to discuss how page developer can whitelist third-party origin with MAC,
but if user is worried about covert channels, *user* has ultimate choice of
whether to allow third-party origin access to an origin's data.

DS: front sections use context and later ones use compartment; we
should stick to one (compartment) for the final camera-ready version
