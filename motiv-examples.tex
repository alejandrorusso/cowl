\section{Primer, Examples, and Goals}

A single top-level web page often incorporates multiple scripts
written by different authors.\footnote{Throughout we refer to ``web
  page'' and ``web application'' (or ``web app'') interchangeably, and
  ``JavaScript code'' and ``script'' interchangeably.} Ideally, the
browser should robustly protect the user's sensitive data from
unauthorized disclosure, yet afford page developers the greatest
possible flexibility to construct rich, featureful applications that
reuse functionality implemented in scripts provided by (potentially
distrusted) third parties. To make concrete the diversity of potential
trust relationships between scripts' authors and diverse ways page
developers may wish to structure amalgamations of scripts, we describe
several example web applications, none of which can be implemented
with strong privacy for the user in today's web browsers. These
examples illustrate key requirements for the design of a flexible
browser confinement mechanism. Before describing these examples,
however, we offer a brief primer on the privacy policy enforced by
status quo web browsers.

%forms the core of our system, \sys{}.

\subsection{Contexts and the SOP}
\label{sec:goals}

\paragraph{Browsing contexts}

\end{figure}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:primer-browser-arch}, a \else A \fi web page
consists of content and JavaScript code.  A \emph{browsing context}
presents a page's content to the user, and JavaScript code accesses
content within the page through the \emph{Document Object Model
  (DOM)}~\cite{html5}. Browsing contexts may be nested (e.g., by using
iframes). They also may read and write persistent storage (e.g.,
cookies) and issue network requests (either implicitly in page content
that references a URL retrieved over the network, or explicitly in
JavaScript, through invoking the \xhr{} (XHR) constructor).

\paragraph{Origins and the SOP}
Since different authors may contribute components within a page,
today's status quo browsers impose a security policy on interactions
among components. Policies are expressed in terms of \emph{origins}.
An origin is a source of authority encoded by the protocol (e.g.,
\js|http|), domain name (e.g., \js|fb.com|), and port (e.g., \js|443|)
of a resource URL.\footnote{For brevity, we elide the protocol and
  port from URLs throughout, and assume that they are respectively
  \js|https| and \js|443|.}

The {\em same-origin policy} (SOP) specifies that resources of an
origin should only be readable by content from the same
origin~\cite{rfc6454, googlehandbook, VanKesteren2012}.  Browsers
ensure that code executing in an \https{a.com} context can only
inspect the DOM and cookies of another context if they share the same
(i.e., \https{a.com}) origin. Similarly, such code can only inspect
the response to a network request (performed with XHR) if the remote
host's origin is \https{a.com}.
%
%% In general, the SOP isolates code in one page from accessing client-
%% and server-side data associated with another origin.
 
The SOP does not, however, prevent code from disclosing data to
foreign origins. For example, code executing in an \https{a.com}
context can trivially disclose data to \https{b.com} by using XHR to
perform a network request; the SOP only prevents the code from
inspecting responses to such XHR requests, but does not impose any
restrictions on sending such requests.
Similarly, code can exfiltrate data by encoding it in the path of a
URL whose origin is \https{b.com}, and setting the \js|src| property
of an \js|img| element to this URL.

% More generally, the ability to embed content from an arbitrary origin
% can also be used to communicate data back into the page and ``bypass''
% the SOP's goal of disallowing cross-origin reads.
% %
% This is possible because most content is not completely opaque. 
% %
% For example, images can encode data in properties such as width and
% height (which are always readable), scripts can encode data in their
% execution sequence (as done by JSON-P~\cite{jsonp}), etc.
% %

% The popularization of JSON-P and other ad-hoc cross-origin
% communication methods, (notably, those relying on \js|window.name| and
% \js|window.location|~\cite{thidpartyjs}), has lead to the introduction
The HTML5 \js|postMessage| API~\cite{webmessaging}.
allows code in different browsing contexts to exchange
messages, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:browser-arch}.
%
% Given a foreign-origin DOM window object \js|win|, the
% \js|postMessage| method can be invoked on it to send the
% foreign origin a message: \js|win.postMessage(message, destOrigin)|.
% %
% Since browsing contexts can be navigated, to prevent man-in-the-middle
% attacks~\cite{barth2009securing}, a second argument
% \js|destOrigin| is used to specify the intended origin of the message.
%
Unfortunately, a sending browsing context has no control over what a
receiving browsing context can do with the the received data. Hence in the
status quo, a developer should only send sensitive data using
\js|postMessage| if she trusts the foreign origin.
%
% in Section~\ref{sec:system:iframe}, we describe how \sys{} precisely
% allows code to impose restrictions on where the foreign-origin can
% disseminate data received via \js|postMessage|, removing this need for
% complete trust.

%\paragraph{Labels}
Having reviewed the building blocks of security policies in status-quo
web browsers, we now turn to examples of web applications for which
strong privacy is not achievable in the status quo. These examples
illuminate key design requirements for the \sys{} browser confinement
system, as well as the overall intuition behind its design.

\subsection{Password Checker}

Given users' propensity for choosing poor (i.e., easily guessable)
passwords, many web sites today incorporate functionality to check the
strength of a password selected by a user and offer the user feedback
(e.g., ``too weak; choose another,'' ``strong,'' etc.). Suppose a
developer at Facebook (at origin \js|fb.com|) wishes to re-use
password-checking functionality provided in a JavaScript library by a
third party, say, from origin \js|sketchy.ru|. If the developer at
\js|fb.com| simply includes the third party's code in a \js|<script>|
tag referencing a resource at \js|sketchy.ru|, then the referenced
script will have unfettered access to both the user's password
(provided by the Facebook page, which the library {\em must} see to do
its job) and to write to the network via XHR. This simple state of
affairs is emblematic of the ease with which na\"{\i}ve web developers can
introduce leaks of sensitive data in applications.

A more skilled web developer could today host the checker script on
her {\em own} server and have that server specify a content security
policy (CSP)~\cite{csp} for the page that disallows scripts within the
page from initiating XHRs to any other origins. But this discretionary
access control policy is {\em too} restrictive, in that it precludes
useful operations by the checker script, e.g., retrieving an updated
set of regular expressions describing weak passwords from a remote
server (essentially, ``updating'' the checker's functionality). Doing
so requires communicating with a remote origin other than that of the
top-level page.\footnote{Unfortunately, even permitting communication
  with the top-level page's same origin is risky---a malicious script
  could then write the password to a public page at that same origin,
  in a {\em self-exfiltration attack}~\cite{selfex}.}

Note that it is entirely safe and useful for an untrusted script to
communicate with remote origins {\em before} it obtains sensitive
data. We note, then, the requirement of a confinement mechanism that
allows code in a browsing context to communicate with the network {\em
  until it has been exposed to sensitive data.} MAC-based confinement
meets this requirement.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{checker-byhand}}
\caption{\label{fig:checker} Third-party password checker architecture
under \sys{}.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:checker} shows how such a design might look. In this
and subsequent examples, rectangular frames denote browser contexts,
arrows denote communication (either between a context and the network,
or IPC-style between contexts), and events during execution are
numbered sequentially in time. Contexts may be {\em labeled} with the
origins to whose sensitive data they have been exposed. A context that
has not yet observed sensitive data is denoted \js|public|, and a page
that contains sensitive data can {\em raise} the label of its own
browsing context to its own origin. Here, a top-level page at
\js|fb.com| encapsulates a password-checker script from a third-party
origin within an iframe browsing context. Each browsing context has a
distinct current label. First, in step (1), the checker script is free
to download updated regular expressions from an arbitrary remote
origin. In step (2), the top-level page sends the user's password to
the checker script's iframe using XHR; the browser {\em labels} the
sent data with the origin of the page that sent it (in this case,
\js|fb.com|). When the browser delivers the password to the checker
script's context, it raises the label of the context to reflect that
the context is about to be exposed to sensitive data from \js|fb.com|,
and atomically denies the context further access to the network, to
prevent exfiltration of the sensitive data. The checker script is then
free to compute the result, which it returns via XHR to the top-level
page; the result carries the label \js|fb.com| to reflect that the
sender may be sending data derived from sensitive data owned by
\js|fb.com|.
% bk: unneeded to clutter this first simple example with the below, as
% other examples illustrate the need for hierarchical confinement?
%  We note further the requirement of a {\em hierarchical}
% confinement mechanism: the checker script may itself invoke untrusted
% code from still {\em other} third-party origins, and should be able to
% further confine such untrusted code.
