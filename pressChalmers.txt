New privacy system could revolutionize the safety of web surfing

To enhance functionality, many of today's web pages are constructed by
assembling building blocks from different companies or independent web
developers, e.g., web pages often include third-party maps when displaying
locations of interest. The diversity and complexity of web pages might cause
third-party components to accidentally leak users' private data. To make the
scenario even worse, third-party content could be malicious, hidden behind
seemingly legitimate web sites. By merely visiting a web page, users can set in
motion pernicious behaviors, which might lead to expose their private data to
unauthorized parties.

For the last four years, Prof. Alejandro Russo (Chalmers) and Prof. David
Mazières (Stanford) have been actively collaborating in developing new
technology to preserve users' privacy. Joining efforts with Google, Mozilla, and
the University College of London (UCL), researchers have recently built a novel
privacy system called 'Confinement with Origin Web Labels' or simply COWL. COWL
protects Internet users’ privacy while flexibly allowing web applications to
combine content from different web sites. COWL provides a property known as
‘confinement’, which has been known since the 1970s, but proven difficult to
achieve in widely deployed systems like web browsers. "What makes COWL unique is
its minimalist design: it naturally extends the existing web security model with
three core concepts on top of which developers can build privacy preserving
web-services. This simplicity, and its low run-time overhead, are key features
making the system attractive to web developers", said Prof. Russo.

COWL works with Mozilla’s Firefox and the open-source version of Google’s Chrome
web browsers. Testing of COWL prototypes for the Chrome and Firefox web browsers
shows the system provides strong security without perceptibly slowing the
loading speed of web pages. Following today's announcement, COWL will be freely
available for download from http://cowl.ws.

The team behind the development of COWL is composed by Stanford's PhDs students
Deian Stefan --- working in collaboration with Mozilla --- and Edward Z. Yang,
PhD. Petr Marchenko from Google, Prof. Brad Karp from UCL, Prof. David Mazières
from Stanford, and Prof. Alejandro Russo from Chalmers.

Implementation (OSDI 2014), a premier venue for operating systems research.
