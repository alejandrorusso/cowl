We implemented \sys{} in Firefox 31.0a1 and Chromium 31.0.1612.0.
%
Because \sys{} operates at a context granularity, it admits an
implementation as a new DOM-level API for the Gecko and Blink layout
engines, without any changes to the browsers' JavaScript engines.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:api} shows the core parts of this API.
%
%Below, we describe the key aspects of our implementation.
%
We focus on the Firefox implementation and only describe the Chromium
one where the two diverge non-trivially.

\label{tab:comm}
\end{table}
 
Gecko's existing isolation model relies on JavaScript compartments, \emph{i.e.,}
disjoint JavaScript heaps, both for efficient garbage collection and
security isolation~\cite{wagner2011compartmental}.
%
To achieve isolation, Gecko performs all cross-compartment
communication (\emph{e.g.,} \js|postMessage| between iframes) through
\emph{wrappers} that implement the object-capability \emph{membrane}
pattern~\cite{miller2003paradigm,miller2006robust}; membranes enable
sound reasoning about ``border crossing'' between compartments. 
%% I want to say that they soundly let us reason about calls back into
%% the caller's compartment and border crossing came to mind, but I
%% don't really like it
%
Wrappers ensure that an object in one compartment can
never directly reference another object in a different compartment.
Wrappers also include a security policy,
which enforces all inter-compartment access control checks
specified by the SOP\@.
%
Security decisions are made with respect to a compartment's
security principal, which contains the origin and CSP of the compartment.

Since \sys{}'s security model is very similar to this existing
model, we can leverage these wrappers to introduce \sys{}'s new
security policies.
%
We associate a label, clearance, and privilege with each compartment
alongside the security principal.
%
Wrappers consider all of these properties together when making
security decisions.

\paragraph{Intra-Browser Confinement}
%
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:comm}, we rely on wrappers to
confine cross-compartment communication.
%
Once confinement mode is enabled, we ``recompute'' all
cross-compartment wrappers to use our MAC wrapper policy and thereby
ensure that all subsequent cross-compartment access is mediated not
only by the SOP, but also by confinement.
%
%%In addition to implementing the MAC wrapper policy (which
%%performs label checks), we modified the function that recomputes
%%wrappers to use \sys{}'s wrappers when confinement mode is enabled.
%
For \js|postMessage|, our policy ensures that the receiver's label
subsumes that of the sender (taking the receiver's privileges into
consideration); otherwise the message is silently dropped.
%
For a cross-compartment DOM property access, we additionally check
that the sender's label subsumes that of the receiver---\emph{i.e.,}
that the labels of the compartments are equivalent after considering
the sender's privileges (in addition to the same-origin check
performed by the SOP).

Blink's execution contexts (the dual to Gecko's compartments) do not
rely on wrappers to enforce cross-context access control.
%
Instead, Blink implements the SOP security checks in the DOM binding
code for a limited subset of DOM elements that may allow cross-origin
access.
%
This approach eliminates the cost of wrapper invocation for communication
between pages of the same origin.
%
Since COWL policies are more fine-grained, we modified the binding
code to extend the security checks to all DOM objects and also
perform label checks when confinement mode is enabled.
%
\todo{ds}{Note here on what we do to address lack of revocation.}

Our implementations of LWorkers, whose API appears in
Figure~\ref{fig:api:compartments}, reuse labeled contexts
straightforwardly.
%
In fact, the \js|LWorker| constructor simply creates a new
compartment with a fresh origin that contains a fresh JavaScript
global object to which we attach the XHR constructor, COWL API, and
primitives for communicating with the parent (\emph{e.g.,}
\js|postMessage|).
%
Since LWorkers may have access to their parents' DOM, however, our
wrappers distinguish them from other contexts to bypass SOP checks and
only restrict DOM access according to MAC.
%
This implementation is very similar to that of the content scripts
used by Chrome and Firefox extensions~\cite{Carlini:2012, addon-sdk}.
In fact, our Firefox implementation uses the same \js|Sandbox|
objects~\cite{mdn-sandbox} used by the Add-on SDK's content scripts.
 
\paragraph{Browser-Server Confinement}%External Communication}
%
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:comm}, we confine external communication
(including XHR, content loading, and navigation) using CSP\@.
%
%% CSP provides developers with a
%% means for whitelisting the origins from which their application is
%% allowed to load resources~\cite{csp}.
%% %
%% Although CSP was originally limited to address XSS
%% attacks~\cite{kerschbaum2007simple}, in practice, the mechanism has
%% been used to (partially) restrict the origins to whom data can be
%% exfiltrated.
%
While CSP alone is insufficient for providing flexible
confinement,\footnote{
There are two primary reasons. First,
JavaScript code cannot (yet) modify a page's CSP\@.
And, second, CSP does not (yet) provide a directive for restricting 
in-browser communication, \emph{e.g.,} with \texttt{postMessage}.
}
it sufficiently addresses our external communication concern by
precisely controlling from where a page loads content, performs XHR
requests to, \emph{etc.}
%
To this end, we set a custom CSP policy whenever the compartment label
changes, \emph{e.g.,} with \js|COWL.label|.
%
For instance, if the effective compartment label is
\js|Label("https://bank.ch").and("https://amazon.com")|, all the
underlying CSP directives are set to \js|'none'| (\emph{e.g.,}
\js|default-src 'none'|), disallowing all network communication.  We
also disable navigation with the \js|'sandbox'|
directive~\cite{csp1.1,whatwg-html,html5}.
%

\paragraph{Browser Storage Confinement}
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:comm}, we use the \js|sandbox| directive to
restrict access to storage (\emph{e.g.,} cookies and HTML5 local
storage~\cite{html5}), as have other systems~\cite{Akhawe2013}.
%
%% Specifically, when the effective compartment label is a conjunctive
%% label (or a singleton whose origin is not the initially set origin),
%% we change the compartment principal to a fresh, unique
%% principal by setting the \verb|sandbox| flag.
%% %
%% This effectively amounts to changing the origin of the browsing
%% context, and thus ensures that the document can no longer access its
%% original storage.
%
We leave the implementation of labeled storage as
future work.


%\subsection{\sys{} DOM objects}
%
%DOM objects such as \js|Label|s and \js|Privilege|s are implemented in
%C++ and made available to JavaScript using DOM binding code.
%%
%The implementation of labels and privileges is straight forward and
%follows directly from~\cite{stefan:2011:dclabels}.
%
%%% We solely remark that this approach of 
%%% imlementation corresponds to rougly 1/3 of
%%% the \sys{} code base; this large fraction is a direct result of using
%%% C++ and having to, for example, implement method overloading to
%%% support a friendly API and handle exceptional code with error codes.
%%% Do we care??
%
%\paragraph{Labeled blobs}
%%
%The implementation of labeled blobs is mostly straightforward.
%%
%
%%
%However, there are two interesting details.
%%
%First, instead of overloading the definition of \js|postMessage| to
%allow sending labeled data across browsing contexts, we modified the
%layout engine to add support for structurally cloning labeled blobs;
%this allows us to flexibly use labeled blobs where other structurally
%clonable objects (\emph{e.g.,} JSON) can be used, including \js|postMessage|.
%%
%Second, we modified the XHR code to allow arbitrary cross-origin reading
%when the response type is set to \verb|labeled-blob|;
%%
%as a consequence, the \js|response| attribute returns a labeled blob.
%%
%Unfortunately, the XHR specification for other attributes, such as
%\js|status|, is to return primitive values (non-objects) and our
%implementation raises the current label to reflect the observation of
%potentially sensitive data.\footnote{
%An alternative implementation can, at the cost of backwards
%incompatibility, label all the attributes of XHR instead of raising
%the current label and returning the ``unlabeled'' attribute.
%}
%

%%\subsection{Lightweight Workers}
%%%
%%The \js|LWorker| API in Figure~\ref{fig:api:compartments}
%%creates and communicates with lightweight labeled workers.
%%%
%%These are distinguished from ``normal'' workers, which create a new OS
%%thread. The constructor code for \js|LWorker| simply creates a new
%%compartment that contains a fresh JavaScript global; the execution of
%%this code shares the event loop with its parent (much like creating a
%%callback with \js|setTimeout|).
%%%
%%As such, a page can confine code without incurring the
%%costs of creating OS threads or full IPC for message
%%passing. Dispatching messages to/from lightweight workers is cheap
%%since the data is on the same heap.
%%%
%%(Of course, this also means that the worker cannot run in parallel.)
%%%
%%More importantly, the sharing of the event loop also allows a page to
%%give workers access to its DOM\@.
%%%
%%This implementation is very similar that of
%%Add-on SDK content-scripts~\cite{addon-sdk}; in fact, our Firefox
%%implementation uses the same \js|Sandbox| objects~\cite{mdn-sandbox}
%%used by these content scripts.
