\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\label{sec:discussion}


\subsection{Covert channels}
\Red{Make sure to note that in the presence of covert channels
relaxing the SOP is very dangerous. So, COLWorkers could really be
limited to extensions/pages that explicitly request this feature.}

\subsection{DC labels}

The implementation of \sys{} is tighten to DC labels. This design decision has
several consequences. Firstly, users familiar with other labeling systems
(e.g. DLM) might need to perform some encoding in order to use
them~\cite{GenLabels}.  Secondly, and more importantly, \sys{} only enforces
latticed-based policies, i.e., labels dictate where information can be
disseminated.  While useful for our purposes, such policies might not capture
all the desire ones for confinement. For instance, it is known that
lattice-based policies are not suitable for scenarios with circular flows of
information~\cite{Badger:1995}. Moreover, DCS~\cite{Akhawe2013} enforces any
confinement policy which can be written as a program. While DCS support more
powerful policies than \sys{}, writing policies as programs might be error
prone. Instead, we design \sys{} to enforce weaker, although useful,
confinement policies based on the specification of data labels.

Can only express latticed-based policies. Can't express all kinds of
policies. But we speculate that this is good enough; i.e., dclabels
are a good match for the web scenario where we already express
policies in terms of origins.
