\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\label{sec:discussion}


\subsection{Covert channels}
\Red{Make sure to note that in the presence of covert channels
relaxing the SOP is very dangerous. So, COLWorkers could really be
limited to extensions/pages that explicitly request this feature.}

\subsection{DC labels}
Can only express latticed-based policies. Can't express all kinds of
policies. But we speculate that this is good enough; i.e., dclabels
are a good match for the web scenario where we already express
policies in terms of origins.
