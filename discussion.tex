\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this section we discuss various design trade-offs, the limitations
of \sys{} that arise as result of these trade-offs, and future work
directions for addressing some of these limitations.


\paragraph{Covert Channels}
In an ideal confinement system, it would always be safe to let untrusted
code compute on sensitive data.
%
Unfortunately, real-world systems such as browsers typically have
\emph{covert} channels which malicious code may exploit to exfiltrate
sensitive data.
%
Since our implementations of COWL modify existing browsers, we do not
protect against covert channel attacks.
%
Indeed, malicious code can leverage covert channels already present in
the browser to leak sensitive information.
%
For instance, a malicious compartment may exploit rendering durations,
as in~\tocite{}, to leak sensitive data to a less-tainted compartment
which may, in turn, exfiltrate the data to a remote host.
%
Importantly, however, COWL does not introduce new covert channels--our
implementations re-purpose existing (software-based) browser isolation
mechanisms (V8 contexts and SpiderMonkey compartments) to enforce MAC
policies.
%
Moreover, these MAC policies are generally more restricting than
existing browser policies: they prevent unauthorized data exfiltration
through \emph{overt} channels and, in effect, force malicious code to
resort to using covert channels.


COWL only relaxes existing policies with \lcors.
%
As described in Section~\toref{}, a compartment can use \lcors{} to
read cross-origin XHR responses otherwise not be permitted by the SOP
or (potentially) even CORS.
%
Of course, COWL confines such code and restricts its ability to
communicate once it inspects a response.
%
But, nevertheless, if the code is malicious it may potentially leak the
sensitive information through a covert channel.
 
At first this may appear as new risk.
%
However, we remark that \lcors{} is user controlled (e.g., the user
must explicitly allow \https{mint.com} to read \https{amazon.com} and
\https{chase.com} data), and code reading cross-origin data is
subject to MAC (e.g., \https{mint.com} will arbitrarily exfiltrate
the \https{amazon.com} or \https{chase.com} data after reading it).
%
This is in contrast to the approaches used by existing mash-up such as
\https{mint.com} which ask users for their passwords.
%
Indeed, COWL is a strict improvement over existing approaches: when
deciding to trust a mashup integrator such as \https{mint.com} users
are only trusting the app to not leak their data through covert
channels.

Trustworthy developers can further leverage COWL's support for
\emph{clearance} when compartmentalizing their application to ensure
that only code that actually relies on \lcors{} can access
cross-origin responses.
%
Clearance is a label that serves as an upper bound on the (current)
label of a compartment and since the current label is adjusted
according to the sensitivity of the data being read, code cannot read
(and thus leak) data labeled above the clearance.
%
Hence, apps like \https{mint.com} can assign a ``low'' clearance to
third-party libraries that they do not trust to keep (e.g.,
\https{chase.com}) data confidential.
%
In turn, these libraries, even if they are malicious, will not be able
to leak such data through covert channels.
%
While COWL fully implements clearance, we do not discuss it further;
our treatment of it is standard and follows directly
from~\cite{efstathopoulos:asbestos, Zeldovich:2006,
stefan:2011:flexible, Breeze13}.

% at a low bit rate)}

\paragraph{DC Labels and Lattice-based Policies}
\label{sec:discussion:lattice}
 
Second, and more importantly, \sys{} only enforces latticed-based
policies, i.e., DC labels dictate where information can be
disseminated.
%
DC labels are similar in expressiveness as the \emph{Decentralized Label
Model}~\cite{GenLabels}(DLM)\footnote{DLM secrecy policies can be encoded as DC
  labels when no principals hierarchy is considered.}, but less expressive than first
order logic. Nevertheless, they closely reflect existing web policies---allowing
COWL to reuse CSP 
to enforce them.
%

%Although DC labels captures a wide-set of policies, it does not capture 
%all possible confinement policies.
%
%For instance, 
Although lattice-based policies capture a wide-set of confinement practices, 
they 
%Lattice-based policies 
are not suitable for scenarios in which a circular flows of information is
desired~\cite{Badger:1995}.
%
Although we could have taken an approach similar to DCS~\cite{Akhawe2013}, where
policies are given in the form of developer-provided code, we believe that the
trade-off for DC labels' simplicity---that of simply specifying which origins
are allowed to read a piece of data---outweighs the ability to specify
arbitrarily policies and the accompanying complexities.
