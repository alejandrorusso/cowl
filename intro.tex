\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Web-based applications have proliferated and found wide use because
their architecture makes it especially easy for developers to reuse
components of pre-existing applications to make new ones. While code
reuse in venerable desktop software has typically taken the form of
libraries, the reusable components in web applications aren't limited
to JavaScript library code---they further include remotely accessible
content and services ({\em e.g.,} map data and storage).


% two goals that are in opposition: (1) flexibility to compose
% services, content, and JavaScript code from multiple parties into
% rich, featureful web-based applications. (2) maintaining privacy
% in such a system, where conglomerations of code written by mutually
% distrusting parties process users' sensitive data. Efforts to
% advance one of these goals unfortunately can often hamper progress
% on the other.
