%Modern web applications comprise a conglomeration of JavaScript from
%multiple authors:  third-party libraries included by a site's
%developer, site-specific scripts by the site developer herself, and
%third-party extensions installed in the browser by the user.  Recent
%years have seen the continual discovery of practical attacks on web
%users' privacy---from the leaking of sensitive data within pages by
%malicious third-party library code, to similar leaks by malicious
%browser extensions, to more subtle leaks, such as those via image
%resources. Fundamentally, these privacy violations occur because
%today's web browsers lack sufficient mechanisms for {\em confining
%  untrusted code.}

Modern web applications are assembled from JavaScript libraries from a
variety of different sources.  All of these scripts have full access to
all of a user's private data, meaning that an application must place
full trust on every library it uses.  The ability to confine JavaScript
in a web browser would permit applications to reduce their trust on
libraries, while at the same time enable mash-up web applications that
could not previously be implemented without compromising user data
confidentiality.
%
We present \sys, a fast, fully backwards-compatible approach to
robust confinement of JavaScript in modern web browsers.
%
Through a series of case-studies, we show how a label-based mandatory
access control system can be used to make existing web applications more
secure, enable the development of other applications that could not be
previously implemented, and even obviate much of the need for privilege
in browser extensions, permitting many of today's extensions to be
realized instead as untrusted web pages.
%
\sys\ has been implemented in both Firefox and Chromium; measurements of
both browsers demonstrate a virtually imperceptible increase in
page-load latency.

%% - privacy vulnerabilities, lack of flexibility in mashups
%% - SOP, CORS, CSP: a patchwork of ad hoc mechanisms
%% - \sys, a simple architecture for confining JavaScript code by limiting
%%   its privileges.
%% - implementations for both Firefox and Chrome open-source browsers.
%% - new portable web applications built on \sys that demonstrate how
%%   \sys simplifies the writing of web applications that robustly preserve
%%   the user's privacy
%% - Measurements of implementations of \sys for both the Firefox
%%   and Chromium open-source browsers demonstrate that \sys's privacy
%%   guarantees incur virtually imperceptible added page-load latency.
