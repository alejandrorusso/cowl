Modern web applications are a conglomeration of JavaScript written by
multiple authors: third-party libraries included by a site's
developer, scripts that implement site-specific functionality written
by the site's developer herself, and third-party extension scripts
installed by the user into the browser. Recent years have seen the
continual discovery of practical attacks on web users' privacy---from
the leaking of sensitive data within pages by malicious third-party
library code, to similar leaks by malicious browser extensions, to
more subtle leaks, such as those via image resources. Fundamentally,
these privacy violations are possible because today's web browsers do
not provide sufficient mechanisms for {\em confining untrusted code.}
We present \sys, a simple but powerful design for robust
confinement of JavaScript code in modern web browsers. \sys
prevents malicious third-party libraries from violating users'
privacy. Its flexible confinement mechanisms allow one to safely
implement mashup web applications that cannot today be built while
ensuring privacy for users. They further obviate giving powerful
privileges to untrusted browser extensions, instead permitting many of
today's extensions to be implemented as untrusted web
pages. Measurements of implementations of \sys for both the
Firefox and Chromium open-source browsers demonstrate that its privacy
guarantees incur virtually imperceptible added page-load latency.
