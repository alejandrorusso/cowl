* Intro

** Problems

*** Third party js libraris way to powerful.  (Examples:  jquery if
    compromised, password strength checker.)

*** Mashup example (NEED GOOD EXAMPLE)

*** Extensions are too privileged (reduces to problem 1).  We need to
    stop treating extensions as their own category.

*** You can't build certain apps today (mint.com, password manager)

** Underlying issue:  need better confinement

*** Currently have privilege separation in the form of iframes

*** Have very crude confinement through CSP (but doesn't solve
    mint.com or mashups or even password strength checker that
    downloads a dictionary)

Don't mention IFC in intro, talk mostly about confinement

* Background

Short tutorial--who are the principals (content provider, server,
third-party library author).  How does executable content work.

Existing mechanisms (SoP, CSP, CORS, etc.)

* "Browbound" Javascript extension

* Leveraging Browbound for web security

** Walk through all problems and examples of intro

E.g., how extensions work

* Evaluation

** Expressivity

*** Lines of code for all examples
    Lines of code for examples you can do with CSP and iframes

*** How many lines of code required to modify existing applications?

** Performance

*** Microbenchmarks (postMessage)

*** Performance impact on existing (legacy) websites

*** Performance impact on less trusted jquery

* Related work

* Discussion

Open questions, security issues

* Summary
